# How I hire for data teams

After many years in research science, where I watched a lot of science presentations and helped interview
a large number of graduate students and postdocs and faculty (I never counted how many), I'm a big fan
of learning from what other people have done, rather than reinventing the wheel. 

I've also blogged and spoken previously about the misery of being an interviewee, so suffice it to say I have
a ton of empathy for how awful it is to go through a bad interview process, and how disappointing it is to 
go through a long, grueling interview and not get an offer. 

I'm also really an engineer in the way I think about things, which is to say I like to iteratively improve 
on any processes I develop. If it's working, great, don't fix it if it ain't broke. 

But I think we can all agree that *hiring in tech is still a work in progress.* 

So here's my current process, partly based off of what the Product Hackers were doing when I joined them 
at Yahoo, and partly based off my own observations of what has worked well over the last few years,  
and what didn't. 

I'm not saying it's perfect, but I've been happy with the candidates I hired. 

I'll also talk a bit about having to miss out on candidates I wanted
but couldn't hire for various reasons. 

## Step 1. Outreach

• Advertising in diverse networks. Pounding the pavement myself. 

## Step 2. Resumé review

• Content

• Verbosity and layout

## Step 3. Phone screen

• SQL vs. python

*Tell me about a project you did, or a job you had where you learned something.*

Talking about past projects is best, but that only works well for senior people, 
and it also takes some experience as the interviewer.

To really do it well and make it fair, you have know what to ask, what to listen for, 
when to dig into something someone mentions in passing, etc. 

Otherwise it can be too biased toward people who are particularly outgoing, 
self-promoting, well-rehearsed, not nervous, or just more like you than the other candidates.

So if you're going to take this approach, try to keep some structure around it to make it easier to 
compare across candidates. 

Here are the basics I try to cover, and some people need more prompting than others:

1. What was the business proble you were trying to solve?
2. What approaches did you consider? 
3. Where did the data come from? 
4. What did you end up doing? 
5. Who else worked on this project with you? How was the work divided?
6. What was the end result of your project? Was it successful? How could you tell? 
7. What would you do differently if you could do it over again? 

Having said all that, if you have to hire very junior people, that's not going to work. They won't 
have projects they can talk about that are directly relevant to the role, or they will have been mostly
just following directions. In those cases, it's hard to get a sense for whether they can handle responsiblity. 

*Story time*: I remember interviewing a technicians for one lab I worked in. We didn't have any 
candidates (college students or recent graduates) who had experience with breeding, feeding, and otherwise maintaining
Xenopus Laevis. I ended up asking people about their previous work experience of all kinds. 

I hired one student who had worked with her parents, who owned a Subway sandwich shop. She was
prompt and efficient, took notes, referred back to her own notes frequently, and communicated clearly. 
She learned quickly, asked great questions, and was enthusiastic about trying new things and taking on responsibility. 

I had another student who was super enthusiastic, but her notes were so bad they were basically 
useless. She had done a lot of volunteer work with kids, so she was good at thinking on her feet, but didn't
enjoy the methodical aspect of working at a bench. 

My advisor at the time also hired a guy who had worked in a pet shop. 
On paper, he was perfectly qualified to help take care of the frogs, but in practice, 
he was kind of disorganized and unreliable, and unwilling to 
take on much responsibility without our having to nag him, for example, 
to keep on top of things that were part of his job, like ordering supplies.  

Point being, think carefully about what qualities you want for the role, and hire based on that. More on this in 
the section below about building teams. 

## Step 4. Take-home (or code pairing, though no one has chosen that when I offered it)

• Tiered approach

• Structured data

• Summary statistics

• Room to tell a story

• Unstructured data


## Step 5. Presentation

• 1:1 with me for more junior people

• For the whole team if they're more senior

## Step 6. "Onsite" aka "meet more people + some other stuff"

• Fill the gaps from the take-home

• See how they talk with nontechnical stakeholders

• Code review exercise

## Successes: How this process correlates with on-the-job performance

• People who did well on the interview actually did better on the job. No one did worse. 

• Building a team with a diverse set of talents. 

## Failures: people I couldn't hire

• Unintentionally terrified the candidate, more than once. 

• Lost a candidate I really wanted because she got a better offer. 

• Lost a candidate because I went along with a company process that I knew would not set her up for success.
