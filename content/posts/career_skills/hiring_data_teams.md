# My process

After many years in research science, where I watched a lot of science presentations and helped interview
a large number of graduate students and postdocs and faculty (I never counted how many), I'm a big fan
of learning from what other people have done, rather than reinventing the wheel. I'm also really an engineer
in the way I think about things, which is to say I like to iteratively improve on any processes I develop. 
If it's working, great, don't fix it if it ain't broke. But I think we can all agree that hiring in tech 
is still a work in progress. 

So here's my current process, partly based off of what the Product Hackers were doing when I joined them 
at Yahoo, and partly based off my own observations of what worked well and what didn't. 

I'm not saying it's perfect, but I've been happy with the candidates I hired. 

I'll also talk a bit about having to miss out on candidates I wanted
but couldn't hire for various reasons. 

# Step 1. Outreach

# Step 2. Resumé review

# Step 3. Phone screen

# Step 4. Take-home (or code pairing, though no one has chosen that when I offered it)

# Step 5. Presentation

# Step 6. "Onsite" aka "meet more people + some other stuff"

# Successes: How this process correlates with on-the-job performance

# Failures: people I couldn't hire
