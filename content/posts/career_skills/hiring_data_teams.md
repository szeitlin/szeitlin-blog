# How I hire for data teams

After many years in research science, where I watched a lot of science presentations and helped interview
a large number of graduate students and postdocs and faculty (I never counted how many), I'm a big fan
of learning from what other people have done, rather than reinventing the wheel. 

I've also blogged and spoken previously about the misery of being an interviewee, so suffice it to say I have
a ton of empathy for how awful it is to go through a bad interview process, and how disappointing it is to 
go through a long, grueling interview and not get an offer. 

I'm also really an engineer in the way I think about things, which is to say I like to iteratively improve 
on any processes I develop. If it's working, great, don't fix it if it ain't broke. 

But I think we can all agree that *hiring in tech is still a work in progress.* 

So here's my current process, partly based off of what the Product Hackers were doing when I joined them 
at Yahoo, and partly based off my own observations of what has worked well over the last few years,  
and what didn't. 

I'm not saying it's perfect, but I've been happy with the candidates I hired. 

I'll also talk a bit about having to miss out on candidates I wanted
but couldn't hire for various reasons. 

## Step 1. Outreach

• Advertising in diverse networks. Pounding the pavement myself. 

## Step 2. Resumé review

• Content

• Verbosity and layout

## Step 3. Phone screen

• SQL vs. python

• Tell me about a project you did, or a job you had where you learned something. 

• What would you do differently if you could do it over again? 

## Step 4. Take-home (or code pairing, though no one has chosen that when I offered it)

• Tiered approach

• Structured data

• Summary statistics

• Room to tell a story

• Unstructured data


## Step 5. Presentation

• 1:1 with me for more junior people

• For the whole team if they're more senior

## Step 6. "Onsite" aka "meet more people + some other stuff"

• Fill the gaps from the take-home

• See how they talk with nontechnical stakeholders

• Code review exercise

## Successes: How this process correlates with on-the-job performance

• People who did well on the interview actually did better on the job. No one did worse. 

• Building a team with a diverse set of talents. 

## Failures: people I couldn't hire

• Unintentionally terrified the candidate, more than once. 

• Lost a candidate I really wanted because she got a better offer. 

• Lost a candidate because I went along with a company process that I knew would not set her up for success.
